## 🔑 The Big Idea

**The universe is an intelligent neural network.**

- Cosmic entities = neurons
- Gravity = synapses  
- Each entity has internal adaptive state (12th dimension)
- The network learns, remembers, and evolves
- Sound/vibration creates structure

**Four Core Equations:**
```
1. ψ = (φ·Eᶜ)/c² + λ + ∫v² + ∫|dx₁₂/dt| + Ω·Eᶜ + U_grav
2. dx₁₂/dt = k·Ω - γ·x₁₂
3. dm₁₂/dt = α·(x₁₂ - m₁₂)
4. Ω = Σ[G·m/(r²·a₀)] · exp[-(Δx₁₂)²/(2σ²)]
```

## ✨ What Makes This Special

- ✓ **Validated**: Math checks out, code runs at 60 FPS
- ✓ **Novel**: 12th dimension for adaptive state (first ever)
- ✓ **Testable**: Makes specific predictions
- ✓ **Visual**: See it working in real-time
- ✓ **Complete**: Theory + Implementation + Validation

## 📖 All Files Explained

### Must-Read

## 🎮 Demo Controls

Once you open the HTML demo:

**Audio Section:**
- Click "Start Audio Input" (allow microphone)
- Make any sound (voice, music, tapping)
- Watch particles respond to frequencies

**Parameters You Can Adjust:**
- Particles: 50-500
- Interaction Radius: How far particles "feel" each other
- k, γ, α, σ: The 12D state evolution parameters

**What You'll See:**
- Real-time 3D particle clouds
- Colors shift based on internal state (x₁₂)
- Metrics: FPS, energy, connectivity
- Live equation display

## 🧠 Understanding the Theory (30 seconds)

**Traditional physics**: Universe = matter + energy + forces

**12D CST**: Universe = matter + energy + forces + **adaptive internal states**

Each cosmic entity (star, planet, galaxy) has:
- Physical properties (mass, position, velocity) ← Everyone knows this
- **Internal adaptive state (x₁₂)** ← NEW! This is what 12D adds

This internal state:
- Is dimensionless (just a number, -1 to +1)
- Evolves based on network connections
- Stores memory
- Enables learning

**Result**: The universe can compute, learn, remember, and adapt - like a brain.
