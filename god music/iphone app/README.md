### Icon Sizes Required

The app needs icons in these sizes:
- 72x72, 96x96, 128x128, 144x144, 152x152
- 192x192, 384x384, 512x512

**Note**: Icon files need to be created. You can use:

### Hosting Requirements

To work as a PWA, the app must be served over:
- **HTTPS** (required for Service Worker)

Safari on iOS will not allow installation if served over HTTP (except localhost).
